  -follow notes for notebook


155.Min Stack

--Implement Min Stack that performs push , pop and top operations
as stack and in additon to these , a special method getMin() returns min value in stack in O(1) Time Complexity

Python :
 .Using stack Push the Pair of values that can be pushed on to stack
 .Compare value and last element of tuple and use to next push() if value is lesser than last element of tuple
 .Use getMin() to return Minimum element in Stack

C++:
-- Use Pair data structure 



1047.Remove Adjacent Duplicates
  
   -- Using Stack insert each character into stack if and only stack is either empty or current character is not same as top of the stack
   -- Otherwise pop the top of the stack


232.Implement Queue using Stacks (Two) 
-- Use two Stacks for push and pop
.. push() operation insert the value into stack
.. pop():-  Check whether the second stack is empty then 
            copy the elements from 1st stack by deleting each from itself
            and finally return top of 2nd stack and delete eventually
.. peek():- same as the pop but finally return top of the 2nd stack 
            without popping it 
.. empty():- return true if both Stacks are empty 

Using Python


503. Next Greater Element II 
-- use stack to store indices traversed of array
.. if stack is not empty and check ith char of array with the element at 
   index of top of stack if so , pop()
.. if stack is not empty then place value at top of stack in result array
.. push()
.. return result
