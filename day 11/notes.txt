?? 34,35 Try out - Longest Increasing Subsequence

62.Unique Paths
  STEPS:-
    . Consider a Dp list filled with 0's of size m * n where m = rows , n = cols
    . if i = 0 or j = 0 place as 1 (its start place)
    . Store the value as sum of left element + top element
    . Return the value of last postion in 2d array.


1143. Longest Common Subsequence

72. Edit Distance

647. Palindrome Substrings 

494.Target Sum

                        ~~~~~~~~~~ BACKTRACKING ~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                       
1.Trying Multiple desision sequences is called as BACKTRACKING.
2.In backtrack, at every will have multiple choices ,out of which one we need to select.
3.Tring every choice and verifying whether our decision sequence leads to solution or not.
4.Puts additional conditions to reduce recursions that may  save some time.

Ex :- 
  TO FIND NO OF K 1'S IN GIVEN BINARY REPRESENTATION OF N
